        <h1>Dry Martini's recipe</h1>
        <p>Who mixed the world's first Martini? It's a good question, but you could stumble down a very deep, 
        dark rabbit hole trying to find out. Was it a California prospector during the 1849 Gold Rush or the 
        barman at a flossy New York City hotel 50 years later? Most likely, the Martini is a cocktail that 
        came onto the scene in multiple places at once, as bartenders began to experiment with gin and dry 
        vermouth. Regardless, no origin story will leave you feeling as blissful and content as you will feel 
        after drinking a classic, well-made Dry Martini.</p>
        
        <p>When making the drink for yourself, it's imperative that you start with good ingredientsâ€”after all, 
        there's no place to hide in such a straightforward cocktail. Begin with a London-style gin. From there,
         add a little dry vermouth. The ratio is negotiable, but common formulas typically fall in the range of 
         four-to-eight parts gin to one part vermouth. A dash of orange bitters ties the room together.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 ounces gin</li>
            <li>1/2 ounce dry vermouth</li>
            <li>1 dash orange bitters</li>
            <li>Garnish: lemon twist</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the gin, dry vermouth and orange bitters into a mixing glass with ice and stir until very cold.</li>
            <li>Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.</li>
            <li>Garnish with a lemon twist.</li>
        </ol>
