        <h1>White Russian's recipe</h1>
        <p>The White Russian is a decadent and surprisingly easy-to-make cocktail. Combining vodka, Kahlúa 
        and cream and serving it on the rocks creates a delicious alternative to adult milkshakes.</p>

        <p>When making a White Russian at home, choose a decent vodka (a Russian one, if you want to stay on 
        theme) and a good heavy cream. Half-and-half can work in a pinch, but milk will produce a thin drink. 
        Remember: You're aiming for decadence.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ounces vodka</li>
            <li>1 ounce Kahlúa</li>
            <li>1 splash heavy cream</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the vodka and Kahlúa to a rocks glass filled with ice.</li>
            <li>Top with the heavy cream and stir.</li>
        </ol>
