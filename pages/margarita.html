        <h1>Margarita's recipe</h1>
        <p>The Margarita is one of the most popular cocktails in North America—for good reason. Combining the 
        tang of lime and the sweetness of orange liqueur with the distinctive strength of tequila, the classic 
        Margarita strikes all of the right keys.</p>

        <p>When choosing your tequila, quality is key. Opt for a blanco made from 100% blue agave. If it doesn't 
        say this on the label, it's mixto—a tequila composed of up to 49% mystery sugars. And although many people 
        reach for premade sour mix, using fresh lime juice will result in a vastly superior drink. Then there's the 
        orange liqueur. What is a mandatory ingredient for some is rendered optional by others, who replace the 
        sweetener with agave syrup. Go that route, and you get the Tommy's Margarita, which was created in the 
        early '90s at Tommy's Mexican Restaurant in San Francisco.</p>
