        <h1>Mai Tai's recipe</h1>
        <p>The Mai Tai is one of the most famous Tiki drinks in the world. Composed of rum, orange curaçao, 
        fresh lime juice and orgeat (a nuanced almond syrup), it's held sway over cocktail enthusiasts and 
        Tiki aficionados for decades. It even enjoyed a star turn in the Elvis film “Blue Hawaii.”</p>

        <p>While the Mai Tai was created as a way to showcase the flavors of good-quality rum, it took a wrong 
        turn over the decades as bartenders employed bottled juices and mixers. Those yielded neon-colored or 
        overly sweet cocktails. Fortunately, a renewed interest in Tiki cocktails has returned the Mai Tai to 
        prominence as a fresh, balanced, rum-forward cocktail.</p>
