        <h1>Cosmopolitan's recipe</h1>
        <p>The legendary Cosmopolitan is a simple cocktail with a big history. It reached its height of 
        popularity in the 1990s, when the HBO show “Sex and the City” was at its peak. The pink-hued, 
        Martini-style drink was a favorite of the characters on the show. It made its debut during the 
        second season and became a series regular after that.</p>

        <p>The Cosmo was a product of its time. In the late-1980s and early-'90s, vodka was king, but 
        flavored vodka was just finding an audience. When Absolut released its first flavored vodka, the 
        lemony Citron, bartenders had a new toy to work with. Cecchini used it in the Cosmo alongside 
        Ocean Spray, and the vodka-and-cranberry duo is still the preferred pair at most bars today. You, 
        of course, can use whichever citrus-flavored vodka and cranberry juice you like. Just remember: 
        Don't drown your drink in cranberry. Other cocktails like the Sea Breeze call for a heavier measure 
        of cranberry, but here the juice is meant to be only an accent, adding a touch of tartness and color.</p>
