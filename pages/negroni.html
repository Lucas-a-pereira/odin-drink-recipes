        <h1>Negroni's recipe</h1>
        <p>Easy to make and refreshingly bitter, the Negroni is said to have been invented in 
        Florence by the dauntless Italian Count Camillo Negroni in the early 20th century. 
        While at Bar Casoni in Florence, he demanded that the bartender strengthen his favorite cocktail, 
        the Americano, by replacing the usual soda water with gin. To further differentiate the drink, 
        the bartender also employed an orange peel rather than the typical lemon peel.</p>

        <p>So, how do you mix the perfect classic version? Start by selecting the right base materials. 
        The key to a great Negroni is finding a gin-vermouth pairing that complements, rather than overpowers, 
        the bitter, bold flavors of Campari. Once you zero in on a winning trio, write it down, memorize it, 
        and request it at your favorite bar. You'll gain the barkeep's respect, make the count proud and, most 
        importantly, enjoy a good drink.</p>
